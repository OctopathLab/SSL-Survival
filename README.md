We present the first large-scale benchmark of pathology foundational models for survival prediction, where their prognostic robustness is validated on external cohorts.

## About  
This repository contains the code, data splits, and results for our benchmark of nine pathology foundational models across multiple cancer types.  

**Updates coming soon!!**

## 📄 Paper

_Status: in submission_

**&#9733; We have maintained a paper list for the [pathology foundational models](document/pathology_foundational_models.md) we used in our study!**


## 📦 Installation

See [INSTALL.md](document/INSTALL.md) for setup instructions.

## 🔁 Reproducibility

We provided the 5-fold cross validation train/val/test splits in the `splits` folder. The hierarchy is organized as follows: experiment type (cancer_specific or pancancer) → consortium (e.g. TCGA) → tissue region (e.g. Breast) → cancer abbreviation (e.g. BRCA).


## 🙏 Acknowledgments  

This work was supported by Octopath Lab. 
We thank the maintainers of the public and private consortia and foundational models used in this benchmark.
